It was the first morning of my holiday. Thousands of duplicate rooms surrounded 270, all of them dingy, all of them starved of clues of the resort’s medieval theme. There were no suits of plate armour standing along the hallway, my bed was not framed with velvet drapes, and, to my disappointment, the staff at the front desk did not refer to my room as ‘your bedchamber’.</p> <p>The Excalibur was medieval-themed in the same way that a pervert’s doglike if you put a lead on them: they’re more of a dog, but rescue shelters won’t take them and they’ll continue to get digestive issues if they eat kibble. Its unrendered bulk was two imposing two-thousand room blocs adorned with a few small turrets, with a cluster of cartoonish, colourful, and strictly noninteractive towers concentrated above its main entrance.</p> <p>With the blind shut - hell, even with it open - you’d mistake the Excalibur for any other aging budget resort in Las Vegas, even if you’ve never been to Las Vegas. You wouldn’t think it’s a new one, since you’d see the surfaces in the bathroom are yellowing, there’s too much brown for anyone to have said yes, and there’s still the stale stink of cigarette smoke, despite the fact you’ll get ejected if you smoke in your room.</p> <p>The Excalibur seemed like a hotel that would be blown up soon. I don’t mean this in a sinister way. That’s what they do to old hotels in Vegas – blow them up. They replace them with a pile of rubble, which gets cleared away to make an empty lot. Then a construction site grows up out of the lot to crystallize into another hotel. After a few years of that hotel standing around aging, it too gets blown up, and the cycle starts again. I hoped I’d check out before they next blew this one up.</p> <p>So, my room wasn’t a pocket of a medieval castle, nor of a castle-themed hotel, but of a stagnating hotel wearing a cheap castle costume, which had flourished on the grave of some other hotel, and would one day get popped and mopped up to make way for something else.</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p> </p> <p>From the snug motte of my duvet I ordered an Uber for a diner across town named Winnie &amp; Ethel’s. I dressed, left my room, and scanned along the silly long hallway to the elevators. The resort didn’t have roundtower staircases, presumably because these would be impractical for visitors with luggage, particularly those on double-digit floors, so I took an elevator down to the lobby.</p> <p>To get to the Uber pick-up spot I needed to walk through the Excalibur’s casino. I don’t know what games of chance they played in renaissance Europe, but let me tell you I’m pretty sure the Excalibur doesn’t have them, since almost all of the casino’s floorspace was reserved for either slot machines to stand in, or for seats that allowed slot machines to be sat at.</p> <p>There were two reasons I was going to a diner outside of the resort for breakfast. The first was that I was worried I might not be able to digest the food served by the resort’s fast food restaurants. I didn’t object to the food being served quickly, but they were asking people to eat the craziest things, flown or trucked into this patch of the desert specifically for dispensation to the good patrons of the Excalibur and its peer resorts. The second reason was that I was developing an insurgent mentality against the resort. I knew ahead of visiting Vegas that the hotel gambit was to offer cheap room rates in exchange for owning the slot machine closest to where you slept. But I didn’t appreciate that they applied the same logic to the closest calorie to where you slept, or the closest seat not in your room, too, and I was gradually absorbing the distressing lesson that - apart from the floor - there wasn’t a place to sit within a kilometre’s walk of my bed that would cost me less than $10.</p> <p>I cast a dirty and hungry look at the Essentials kiosk on my way out of the lobby. The kiosk and I diverged in our assessment of whether Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Puffs were essential. There were no price tags. No-one was browsing or buying. The only cue the drinks and snacks cost anything, besides the fact that they hadn’t already been taken, was the cash register and its attendant.</p> <p>I passed through a double set of double doors that led outside to the Excalibur pick-up spot. The Excalibur’s pick-up spot and drop-off spot weren’t the same place. While stood in the sun waiting for the Uber, I reflected that the drop-off spot, which was at the entrance to the resort, was sheltered and shaded and featured misters, while the pick-up spot, where I was stood, was a broad hot slate of exposed concrete looking out onto a more slabs of exposed concrete, namely a highway and a carpark. Huh.</p> <p>My Uber arrived. I got in and said hello to the driver. He looked at me warmly through the rearview mirror.</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p> </p> <p>   “Good morning sir! Do you live in Vegas, or are you visiting?” “I’m visiting. Last night was the first night of my holiday. Does anybody that lives in Vegas stay in the Excalibur?”</p> <p>I accidentally sounded sarcastic.</p> <p>   “Well sir, you would be surprised. A lot of people still live in Vegas hotels. Lots of well-known people. There are shows every night of the year. The biggest names have shows here and they need somewhere to stay. And we’ve had the biggest of them all here. You know who I mean?”</p> <p>His lips cracked open to reveal a big smile. His reflection peered over its sunglasses at me.</p> <p>   “Elvis?” “Correct. Elvis Presley. He lived in the Westgate hotel. The biggest of them all. Elvis, I mean. He found his way here from Memphis, Tennessee. Like I always say, the circles are there if you care to look. Here, let me trace one for you.”</p> <p>He drew small rings in the air with his forefinger.</p> <p>   “I myself moved around a lot as a child, being a military dependent. My father moved for work, and so my mother and I moved too. And you know where the Navy moved him? NSA Mid-south, Millington, Tennessee, which is right outside of Memphis, Tennessee. “As a boy I visited a home in Memphis a few times. My mother and father volunteered, helped servicemen settle in. They ran bus tours of the city on weekends. My father would drive, with my mother talking and telling sailors about the city over the PA. And I would go with them. Do you know what one of the stops was on the route we took?” “Elvis’s house?” “Correct. Elvis’s house. You know what he called it? Graceland. And it was beautiful. I knew then that it was something special to me. Elvis came to Las Vegas, and so did I. My wife, she was like a wet cat, had to drag her hissin’ and scratchin’, but I kept telling her it was our path.”</p> <p>His phone, which was cradled between the driver and passenger seats, flashed with a figure of $4.44.</p> <p>   “Look! Did you see that?! Tell me you saw that! Four four four. Four dollars and forty-four cents.”</p> <p>I was unsure of the significance of the number to him and concerned what it might mean for his already erratic lane discipline.</p> <p>   “Hey Siri!” he said to the dashboard, “What is the meaning of the angel number 444?”</p> <p>Siri paused to think about it for a moment, then replied.</p> <p>   “The angel number 444 is commonly interpreted as a sign from the divine that you’re on the right track. It’s a cosmic nudge affirming that whatever is occurring in your life is meant to be and that you’re close to a new beginning.” “See! I know I am on the right track. And the universe is telling me so. I know that good things are coming. You know, I’ve set up in Elvis’s room at the Westgate. And the energy when I did so–”</p> <p>He mouthed an explosion and the eyes beneath his sunglasses blinked in soft shock.</p> <p>   “There was something in that room on that day, I tell you. So many connections! Here, let me show you another.”</p> <p>He fished around in the drivers-side sunvisor for something, then presented it to me.</p> <p>   “Take a look at my license. My name, read my name out loud.”</p> <p>A few days previous I had expressed my amazement to a cab driver that his name was Mr Desert, only to learn that I had confused his name with that of the company he drove for, Desert Cabs. I was apprehensive about making a similar mistake here, which I knew would kill the blossoming significance of the moment. I read cautiously.</p> <p>   “Eric Paul the second?” “And the surname.” “… Roulette?” “Roulette! Eric Roulette! In this city! What a way to tell me that I am on the right track and that I am meant to be here. And boy is it the right name for me. My life’s like playing roulette. I’ve had it all and lost it, then had it all again and lost it once more. “And it’s about time I had it again. I signed two en-dee-ays just last week with Universal Music. You know what Universal Music have? Universal Music have a funk label that they don’t use anymore, Roulette Records. No-one’s on it any more, they haven’t used it in years. But I’m going to ask them to give it to me. I’m going to revive it. I’m going to bring all my artists under it and you know what? There’s going to be me, at the top.”</p> <p>Eric formed his fingers into a crane and mimed planting himself on top.</p> <p> </p> <hr> <p> </p> <p>We pulled off East Flamingo Road, one of the gigantic boulevards that transects the Las Vegas Strip, into what looked like the entrance to a multi-storey carpark. I couldn’t see Winnie &amp; Ethel’s diner.    “I would say it looks like we’re here, except it doesn’t. This is no good, let me drop you further around.”</p> <p>Eric drove on but the road looped back onto East Flamingo.</p> <p>   “Hm, looks like that was it after all. Guess I’ll just have to drop you where we were.” “Remember – it’s DJ Roulette. It was very nice meeting you, have a nice day, and be sure to look me up on YouTube. Remember to like, comment, and subscribe!”</p> <p>I thanked Eric, said I would, stepped out of the car, and waved as he pulled away. I looked around. No Winnie &amp; Ethel’s diner.</p> <p>Five years before meeting Eric, I had developed a superstition about flamingos. I hadn’t been to see a doctor about it, since I thought it was nothing. But now, in Las Vegas, after being dropped off by Eric, I was in the wrong place, and what should there be but a flamingo. Opposite me, across the boulevard, was a flamingo, the Flamingo, a historic casino slap-bang in the middle of the Strip and namesake of Flamingo Road, the first honeytrap of Vegas, a gift from gangster Bugsy Siegel.</p> <p>I checked the map, then I checked Uber. It turned out there was a dud Winnie &amp; Ethel’s marker a kilometre south of the diner’s actual location.</p> <p>Although Eric Paul Roulette II was right where he was meant to be, I, unfortunately, was not.</p> </body></html>
