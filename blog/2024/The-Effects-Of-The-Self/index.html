Like all thoughts, the self is simply an idea the mind uses to make sense of the world. And it’s a pervasive fiction: people are fixated on their own selves and the selves of others. What do I want, how am I feeling, I love them, they have treated me badly, how can I improve, what do you want.</p> <p>A strong signal of the monopoly of the self, besides how much time you spend thinking about yourself - no judgement! - is that it’s almost always been chosen as the dominant unit of moral, political, and legal currency. It’s an enormously common substructure of religions and ethical systems. Whether self-serving or altruistic, we’re interested in which selves benefits and tolls accrue to, who owns what, and often especially what’s in it for us.</p> <p>Because the self is a pervasive fiction, both in the sense that it’s shared by everyone, and because of the proximity of “self” and “mind”, it’s easy to forget that it’s a fiction. Meeting a person that does not have a self is rare. It’s a fiction so slippery that it often slides into the bucket of fact. And it’s uncommon to sincerely consider, in principle at least, opting out of having one.</p> <p>The idea of choosing whether to have a self, deciding how tightly to embrace its fiction, is novel to me. I know and love that meme about us all being fingers of the universe and understand that non-self, whether as a choice or as an observation, is a major idea of Buddhism. And I try not to be so selfish. But I’ve always interacted with non-self as a tool to be used by the self, such as to make better decisions or as a temporary therapeutic, rather than my default framework for thinking about things. Instead, my go-to way of seeing the world has been old reliable, the selfish agent-oriented view.</p> <p>The self touches all parts of life, so the effects of deciding not to have a self, or displacing it with an alternative concept, could be big. But, at first blush, it seems tricky to opt out.</p> <p>It’s habitual. You’ve lived your entire life, apart from when very young, asking “what should I do? what do I care about?”, and, since you feel it is “you” reading this, understandably might not want to let go of the controls, or just find it too confusing to do so. I find it confusing. I found that writing this, I kept reflexively getting dragged into thinking about how non-self could enable aims of my self.</p> <p>Even if you stop reasoning about yourself as being distinct from other things, other people are certainly going to do it. Most people model others as thinking and acting in terms of a perspective and motivations of a self, and so not having one may make it difficult to be legible to others. People are going to assume you’re cracked. That peer pressure will be persuasive. But maybe the benefits of setting the self aside could be so great that it’s worth the hassle. So what are the effects of having a self?</p> <p>A major one is that thinking in terms of a self allows a person to see themselves as an agent. Their self demarcs a locus of control and intention. We reason in terms of selves because we believe they are convenient units of control and action. Personal agency relies on the idea of self: seeing ourselves as separate from others cues us to the possibility we can have distinct intentions and take action.</p> <p>Another effect of the self is to create a pocket to put information into. Information flow between selves is usually noisier than within a self. Discoordination frequently becomes more likely when trying to coordinate across the boundary of the self. Secrets, distrust of others, and misunderstandings arise because of the ambiguity of intentions and noisy communication - we can’t read minds!</p> <p>By persuading a person that they have a self, you give them a necessary tool for selfish thinking. The bedrock of competition in the social world is and has, for a long time, been the self: who gets what, and what’s in it for me? Even to the most altruistically-minded person, the self makes an intoxicating promise, which in unvarnished terms is “pursue self-serving actions instrumentally, so you can gain power to help others”. Going “ant mode”, doing whatever is in the colony’s best interests, is not in vogue.</p> <p>A challenge to this “the self makes people selfish” line is that if you convince a person that others have selves, you open a door that allows them to see the joy and pain they cause others. Denying that some people have selves, or diminished selves, has been an historical go-to for making it permissible to do awful things to others. But – in principle the sentience of other living things could be acknowledged without needing to label them as selves.</p> <p>The self may be marketed as a fiction that makes life easier, but in some cases clearly creates entirely new problems, largely those of ego. If you have been ignored while waiting to order a drink at a bar, you know that you can find someone denying the existence of your self upsetting. But, in cases like this, your self lays the bear trap it steps into: the “I” your mind constructs is upset the bar staff don’t acknowledge it, but can only be upset because it asserts it exists. If you didn’t insist on the reality of your self, there would be nothing to be upset about.</p> <p>Your self contemplating what it wants, deserves, and considers just can, and I think often is, addictive, counterproductive, and painful. It feels rubbish. And getting emotional from it can cause you to make poor decisions and hurt others. Focusing on your self too much also diminishes your self-awareness, a blindness to the periphery that sets the conditions for suffering. And! Thinking in terms of your self incurs the opportunity cost of not reasoning in other units, such as an organisation or movement, which may be far more clarifying.</p> <p>You abandoning the idea of the self altogether seems tricky and disorienting. But it at least seems wise to research the effects of the idea of the self, given its prevalence and influence. I haven’t entertained alternatives to the self here. Instead, I focused on a few of the structures and dynamics that the self is necessary for. But I’d like to explore alternatives, possibly starting with how the ants do things.</p> <p>Accepting a fiction as an objective truth rather than something that can be picked up and put down is risky and blinding. An omnipresent fiction that is necessary for selfishness, distrust, and that manufactures new reasons to feel pain and cause others to suffer, seems particularly risky and blinding. The fact that the idea of the self is coercive, being difficult to live without and without clear alternatives, is all the more reason to challenge its authority.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-update-flash-ai-assistant-io-2024/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</a> <svg width="1rem" height="1rem" viewbox="0 0 30 30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path d="M17 13.5v6H5v-12h6m3-3h6v6m0-6-9 9" class="icon_svg-stroke" stroke="#999" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path> </svg> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="https://medium.com/@al-folio/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog-b60a1d241a0a?source=rss-17feae71c3c4------2" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</a> <svg width="1rem" height="1rem" viewbox="0 0 30 30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> <path d="M17 13.5v6H5v-12h6m3-3h6v6m0-6-9 9" class="icon_svg-stroke" stroke="#999" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path> </svg> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/2025-03-22-Chronicles-I-All-Circles/"></a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/twig-2/">twig-ii.js</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/twig/">twig.js</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Jerome Wynne.
