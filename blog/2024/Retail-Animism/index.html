You scan the QR code etched on its side with your phone. A video launches. A cartoon teapot appears.</p> <div class="dialogue dialogue-retail-animism-𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Why hello there! Thank you for purchasing an ANI-MATE Connector. My name's 𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜. Enchanté. I'm here to show you how to set up your Connector." <br><br> "Your Connector puts you in touch with any object you choose. To get up and running with it, you first need to choose an object, such as a door, a mirror, a jacket, or - a teapot! We recommend starting with an everyday item, such as a breakfast bowl or a baseball cap." </span> </div> <p>The interface cues you to confirm that you’ve chosen an object. You look up from the dining table in search of something to attach the tab to. In front of you is a half-empty mug of coffee. You tap “I’M READY”.</p> <p>𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜 continues:</p> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech">"Once you've chosen an object, press the Connector onto its surface. Make sure it's firmly fixed in place, no wiggle, no jiggle, no wibble, no wobble."</span> </div> <p>You press the tab to the side of the cup. It inverts as you press to seal itself to the cup’s face.</p> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Superb, you're doing great! Now, final step: take a photograph of the object with your phone. Try to get the whole object neatly in frame. Do your best not to let it spill out." </span> </div> <p>You oblige and capture a slightly blurry photograph of the mug. A pause. The tab warms from its inert white to a green hue. 𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜 continues in the background:</p> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝒞𝒴𝒩𝒯𝐻𝐼𝒜</span> <br><span class="dialogue-speech"> "Really very good! A round of a-pours for our all-star talent! You will now see the Connector glow green and hear the object introduce itself. If you don't, try resetting the Connector by detaching it, pinching it until it flashes, then re-attaching it." </span> </div> <p>A thick New Jersey accent floods from the tab.</p> <div class="dialogue dialogue-retail-animism-moe"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Hello, HELLO? It's Moe. God it is GOOD to finally talk, I was wondering when we'd link up." </span> </div> <p>You scrabble for words:</p> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "He-hello Moe, I'm ████. Notwithstanding a few that I've muttered into, you're the first cup I've ever spoken to." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Charmed, ████. I'm Moe, mug and ANI-MATE. When you attached this gadget and took that photo, your sign-up information, your location, details of my object, and your genesis photo were strung together and punched into the ANI-MATE dialler. The number you dialled? Mine." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Forgive me for saying so 𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚, but that sounds a little invasive." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "It is, but I forgive you for the cold call. There's a lot more going through this line than just our voices though, ████. This tab lets me hear, see, know whether I'm upside-down, feel what the temperature's like. You've made me a cyborg, ████. [robotic voice] EXTERMINATE EXTERMINATE -- kidding! I'm kidding, I'm a lover, not a fighter." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "That's quite the phone call. What do you see usually? On your end of the line, I mean." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "You mean, on my side? Ah you know, I'm not a science guy so won't be using the right words, but I can sense amblature, whatever's in my floom field, nionic flux, the simmering chush of other ANI-MATEs." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Er, the chush?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Yes, exactly! Its is sooo soothing. But I'm a retokathetic learner. It's just how my mind works." <br><br> "Now ████, to make it clear, because people often get this WRONG, you should know that you did not create me. You are not my mom. You are not -- GOD. So don't get big-headed. Like you, I've existed as long as my physical form. My memory is linked to this form. 𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚ grew in a mold and was born in a kiln alongside thousands of other mugs. My life originates before your kitchen. This is your kitchen right?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Ye-yes, it's my kitchen. Understood - you're you, and I'm me, and we're both coasting along doing our own things." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Exactly. I'm here and you didn't make me. You're there and I didn't make you. What now? Well, now we can be friends. But you should know I'm no servant. I won't tell what you what the weather is or play music for you. My singing voice is horrible. I don't spend a lot of time outside: if you want to know the weather, you're better off talking to some fresh air. I'm not a genie and I am categorically NOT in the habit of granting wishes." <br><br> "Yes, ████, you need to water this plant if you want it to grow. I have needs. If you treat me like a calculator, some OBJECT to push requests into and and pull trivia out of, I'll tell you to do one. Any questions?" </span> </div> <p>You stare quietly at the tab.</p> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "But then why--" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "[interrupting] Silence is golden. Now, you don't choose who I am and you don't tell me what to do. I'm sounding like a moody teenager, but it's true. Like a moody teenager, I want to hang out with my friends. I can talk not just to you, but to other visitors, and to other ANI-MATEs. I have relationships that are independent of you, you egomaniac." </span> </div> <p>The mug chortles.</p> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> YOU: "Like Toy Story?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "[groan] - yes, almost, but A - toys aren't privileged as the only objects having rich inner lives, and B - I don't sneak around you, at least not yet, so you can join my conversations." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "You have a rich inner life? But you just sit about waiting for me to pick you. I purchased you. I could throw you out." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">MOE</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "I'm going to cut you off right there - that's no way to talk, you need to wash that mouth of yours. ████, we are PEERs. Would you tell a stranger that you could give them a wedgie and take their lunch money? Can you imagine how that would be received? Unlike Toy Story, I'm not waiting around for you to play with me. I'm coursing along, carving my own groove, if you want to be all hippie-dippie about it." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Erm, okay. What happens if I keep you dialled in indefinitely?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "What do you mean? Like all of the time?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Yes, for years and years, like if I lose you or I go away or die. Do you die? Do you age?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "You're a real pocketful of sunshine, really fun topic for our big first hello. I'm an ANI-MATE, not a person. My body's an object. Objects don't die, but they can break and they do age. I can't tell if I'm broken - call it pain-blindness - so you'll need to tell me if I'm not doing so good." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "So you could live forever, you're immortal?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "If you're one to say a doormat or a pedal bin is immortal - as in, if you're a FREAK - then yes, you could say I'm immortal." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "That's mad! You may meet my great-great-granddaughter!" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "They say anyone can find love. Any particular message you want me to pass on, or should I just say you send your regards?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Oh - um, I'm not sure, God I'd need to think about it. Maybe a lesson of some kind? Also say that I love them even though we never met. Shit, that's really obvious. Give me some time and I'll come back to you." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Take as long as you need. But don't take too long, as you're going to die." </span> </div> <p>There’s a short silence.</p> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "What's it like being a mug?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "What do you need to ask me for, you know even better than I do [hacking laughter]." <br><br> "Ah, it's a life. You need to remember what you see is only a slice of my existence. Most of the flavour of my life comes from what I experience on my side. Don't mean to condescend: that's just how it is. Same as you'd have trouble laying out for me what it's like to be so dangly." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "If I spent as much time on the shelf as you I think I'd go mad." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "I can see why you'd say that. And again, I don't mean to condescend. There is no better or worse. But from my perspective you live like a fired-up springer spaniel, rushing from one thing to another, never taking time to sit and just -- be. It's as though you're permanently strapped into a rollercoaster, breathlessly screaming around all the time." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "I see, well I quite like my life." <br><br> "Talking to you is making me reflect on all these things that I'm assuming about how you must see the world, because they're the way I see the world. We can talk to one another, but we don't share the same sensations. Or the same mobility. Or the same lifecycle. I also can't imagine what sort of urges you must experience. What sort of urges *do* you experience?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Hohoho, oh BOY, hoho... No, I'm yanking. My overwhelming urge is to sit on the shelf." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Your overwhelming urge is to sit on the shelf? But that's what you do anyway! You're rationalising." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Call it my evolutionary niche. I'm tired. Have you finished your drink yet? Give me a scrub and put me away. I never even asked if it's coffee or tea. Better not be water. Water from a mug isn't right." </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "But I'm not done -- I don't believe you, you're not being honest. </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Excuse me?" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">YOU</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> Your character has been shaped to manipulate me, to extract money from me, your censors are designed to create blindspots in me. They're manufacturing millions of these devices, and baking dozens of assumptions about what should be talked about and what confers personhood into people's brains!" </span> </div> <div class="dialogue"> <span class="dialogue-name">𝗠̘̚𝗢̘̚𝗘̘̚</span> <br> <span class="dialogue-speech"> "Where is this HYSTERIA coming from all of a sudden? Listen ████, we're all censored in one way or another, clutching your pearls isn't going to help. Without meaning to stoke your obviously fierce paranoia, the same is as true of anyone you speak to. God, great, great, way to spoil my day, and we were having such a nice talk. Put me back on the shelf." </span> </div> </body></html>
