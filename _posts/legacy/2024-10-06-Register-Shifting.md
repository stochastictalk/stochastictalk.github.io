For a while I’ve been meaning to play a game. I came up with the game because I saw language leaking between parts of my life. I saw the same happening in other people, too. I wondered how hard it would be to achieve the effect consciously and what possibilities it might unlock. 

Linguistic smudging, or ‘register shifting’, is generally permitted more than wearing a suit to the beach, or treading slippers into a serious business meeting. In speech, we have impressions. But, based on many tortured business emails, I think people generally don't feel confident switching register in their writing. 

Unlike in fashion, analysis of clashes and enhancements created by register mixing and shifting usually proceeds along the lines of ‘this is formal, this is informal, do not mix’. I suspect this is a missed opportunity - there’s not only the possibility of making a gaffe, but also the prospect of making a brilliant mistake. A studied violation of norms is an innovation. I suspect writers of genre fiction would probably crucify me for saying something like this, but I'd bet good money many people pay more heed to fashion categories than linguistic registers, particularly as applied to writing.

The premise of the game I've wanted to play is simple. Instead of trying to inhabit a ‘correct’ style, as - in my view, confusingly - gets encouraged in some books on writing style, the objective is instead to steal the style of a target text and apply it to different content. I call the game Camouflage.

The content and style distinction in Camouflage is as follows: content refers to the underlying idea discussed, whereas style refers to the tools used to express that idea. Content is what’s depicted, and style is the depiction. So the goal of Camouflage is to change the underlying idea being discussed, but to recreate stylistic qualities such as tense, perspective, lexicon, rhythm, tone, and melody. 

Here’s an example to show you what I mean. The target’s this excerpt from The Secret Room by Roderick Hunt and Alex Brychta, reprinted without permission (sorry):

> Biff and Chip liked the new house. They helped Mum and Dad.
> Mum put wallpaper on the wall. Chip helped her.
> Dad painted a door. Biff helped him.
> Biff was in her room. Dad looked at the wallpaper.
> Biff wanted new wallpaper.
> They went to the wallpaper shop.
> Biff looked at the wallpaper. She liked this wallpaper.

The underlying idea here is tricky to explain more clearly than it’s put in the text: Biff, Chip, and their parents have a new house, and they have decorated it by painting and putting up wallpaper. Good for them.

We could lay out the characteristics of the style in all sorts of ways, ranging from individual words, to patterns among groups of words, to the overall effect of the text. 

The verb conjugation puts the text in the past tense. Chronology and duration are implied only loosely by the order of statements, not by temporal connectives. The emphasis is squarely on people, who are always the subject of the sentences, and the sentences all have a simple structure. People are only referred to in the third person. 

The sentences are almost all logically independent - the only exceptions are those that contain pronouns ‘they’, ‘her’, ‘him’, and ‘she’. But these only refer to antecedents (things) in the previous sentence, meaning even very forgetful readers, like me, can manage.   

Only one adjective is used, ‘new’. The proper nouns are all single-syllable. The non-proper nouns all unified by the theme of ‘DIY’ - ‘house’, ‘wallpaper’, ‘wall’, ‘door’, ‘room’, ‘wallpaper’, ‘wallpaper shop’. There are no abstract nouns. Though there are both concrete and abstract verbs - ‘put wallpaper on’, ‘liked’, ‘helped’, ‘painted’, ‘looked’, ‘was in’, ‘looked at’, ‘wanted’, ‘went to’.

There is one phrase that sticks out to me: ‘this wallpaper’. The thing I find strange here is the use of the word ‘this’. Reading the dictionary, ‘this’ is often used in one of two senses. It gets used as a ‘determinative’ i.e. to point to something, as in ‘this pair of trousers is too big for me’, or ‘this tasmanian devil won’t stop terrorising the chickens’. And it gets used as a pronoun, which basically means as a determinative for something in the surrounding text: ‘Remove the jammed paper from Zone 2. This will fix your problem.’ or ‘A lit candle melts. This is by design.’.

But why should we care about ‘this’ for Camouflage? What does it mean for the game?! Well, in this particular case, which is admittedly borderline, I see a subtle reference to something not contained in the text: a reference to an illustration. Rug pull: the text is from a picture book, and the associated picture of this sentence contains Biff pointing at a fetching swatch of graph check wallpaper. That wallpaper is the ‘this wallpaper’.

The writing’s so simple that almost any two adjacent sentences are nearly enough to get a good representation of the entire text. Blah blah, that’s definitely enough analysis, play the game! Here's my attempt:

> Pick and Poke went to the park. Poke put a blanket on the grass. Pick sat on the blanket. 
> Teacher gave Pick a green apple. Pick thanked her.
> Poke saw a bee. Teacher did not like the bee.
> Poke and Pick wanted to play. They went to the playground.
> Poke sat in this swing. Pick pushed her.
> Poke and Pick felt tired. They told Teacher.

This was underwhelming and sort of boring to write. It felt more like a high-school exercise than a game. But the analysis was fun. I suspect a more complicated target, which is less self-consciously designed, will be more fun.

Okay this is a good one. And a recent development, too: [new Guinness World Record for the paper straw Capri-Sun speedrun](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2024/10/tricky-capri-sun-paper-straw-record-finally-claimed-by-speed-eater-mike-jack). 

> Champion speed eater Mike Jack has done what many thought was impossible – broken the record for fastest time to drink a Capri Sun (paper straw).
> Trust us, it’s WAY tougher than it sounds.
> Many people, including Mike, had tried and failed in the past, leaving the record unclaimed until now.
> During a visit to Guinness World Records HQ in London, Mike, from Canada, decided to shoot his shot one more time.
> And it finally paid off thanks to some clever tactics from his wife and coach, Jamie.
> Mike, a serial record breaker, claimed the title with a time of 21.71 seconds.

I actually take their point - drinking a Capri-Sun with a paper straw is probably WAY tougher than it sounds. 

This time I’m going to simply show you the camouflage in action, and cram the details of the features I picked out to the bottom of this post.

> Banana theft kingpin Big Mike has once again defied people who labeled him 'reformed', this time by ransacking a plantation owned by a banana trade rival. 
> Make no mistake, Mike is STILL the baddest banana thief around. 
> Many had hoped Mike had turned a corner after being let out of Sacramento County Jail in November, and were eagerly waiting for him to show he’d turned over a new leaf.
> But, while visiting a rival’s plantation in Panama, Mike decided to try his luck once again, hijacking a fully-loaded truck of bananas and exchanging gunfire with plantation security.
> After a high-speed pursuit lasting over four hours, local police were able to stop Mike in his tracks and put him into cuffs, thanks in part to the quick wit of plantation operator Paolo Cavendish.
> Asked about the mayhem, Paolo commented “It’s a lot - I’m just glad the bananas were returned unharmed”.
> Mike, a serial law-breaker, is to be extradited to the United States from Panama in January and is due to appear at Kern County Superior Court in March.

The sentences are too long and the valence is far less wholesome, but not bad.

My approach to the game here has been analytic, but you could also play impressionistically. The real skill is to be able to do this quickly - I think at first it’s worth doing the dog work of decomposing the writing, but suspect that over time it becomes something that can be done spontaneously. Disection's ugly and bloody but rooting around in the guts is good practice for building a body from scratch, and for fixing one when you think it's gone wrong. 

Appendix: break down of Guinness World Record article's pieces and patterns:
* Idea: man struggles, succeeds in speedrunning Capri-Sun with paper straw
* People: Mike Jack (what a name, nearly ‘mic check’, would be a great name for a sound engineer), ‘many’, ‘us’, the reader (implicitly via ‘trust us’), ‘many people’, ‘Jamie’
* Places: Guinness World Records HQ, London, Canada
* Tense: first two sentences refer to the present, the rest refer to the past in a linear chronology 
* Verbs: ‘has done’, ‘broken’, ‘sounds’, ‘tried and failed’, ‘trust’, ‘claimed’, ‘decided’, ‘paid off’.
* Adjectives and adverbs: ‘champion speed eater’, ‘impossible’, ‘tougher’, ‘unclaimed’, ‘finally’, ‘clever’, ‘wife and coach’, ‘serial record breaker’
* Pronouns: ‘it’
* Paragraphs: every paragraph is a single complex and/or compound sentence
* Structure: first sentence summarises the story, subsequent text provides detail. It’s rightly framed as a tale of heroism
* Errors? The text says the record has been broken and was previously unclaimed. Call me sensitive, but the second ‘it’ is vague enough to put me on edge.
