Why did Ahab want to kill Moby Dick? Because Moby Dick took his leg, because the ivory replacement clattered on the foredeck of the Pequod at night and prompted second mate Stubb to whinge, and because the foul mood that clings to chronic amputative pain causes a sea-captain to fester to a murderous boil. Were the truth of any of these facts different, Ahab might not have wanted to kill Moby Dick. But being true as they were and are, Ahab did want to kill Moby Dick.

Ahab’s intention was singular. He made no attempt to conceal it. Early in the assassinative voyage he assembled the entire crew of the Pequod, whom all thought they had contracted with a commercially-motivated captain, to explain that (1) he wanted to kill Moby Dick, (2) that’s all he wanted, and (3) he wanted to kill Moby Dick for no reason other than to have killed Moby Dick. Ahab shrouded his aim in no skimask of instrumental reasons - the permacetti, the money, the legend, the reputation, the pride, the safety of other whalers, the extinguished threat of the white whale hunting him down to finish off the job. No, instead he unabashedly marked his aim out as terminal, nakedly presenting that its meaning rested on nothing but itself. 

Ahab knew the crew would only care about Moby Dick because it (he? Feels inappropriate) was another whale to include in the voyage’s catch. To spur particular interest in this one whale he offered the bounty of a gold doubloon to the harponeer that initiated its induction to the haul. But Ahab made no real attempt to bind anyone else with the same mysterious autonomic spell that transmuted him into an instrument for killing the whale, a device enraged and staminal enough to spend three treacherous years groping through all of the earth’s oceans in search of the submerged thimble of the snow hill. And, although Ahab and the crew of the Pequod knew Ahab’s intention seemed errant, and that he was executing strange commands on the bare metal of purpose, there was no dissuading him of it.

The crew considered Ahab mad, and Ahab knew the world thought him mad. And yes, if Ahab had not wanted to kill Moby Dick, the Pequod would have likely returned safely to a New Bedford harbour. But, if Ahab had not wanted to kill Moby Dick, well, then there would be no _Moby Dick_.
